main.py

## Execute instructions
 pip install spotipy
 pip install streamlit
 python -m streamlit run main.py
 
## Notes
 Currently, the database is storing just my song information.
 If you would like to run the program and access your top songs, I have to add the email associated with your Spotify account to my Spotify project.
 Then, the program will prompt you to sign in and will populate the database with your songs.
